# TaskmanGo
A tasks/to-do command line app written in Go

This was written as a learning exercise to help me get to know Go (Golang). It is not intended to actually be used by anyone!

Tutorials can drive you crazy and they don't cover everything. Escape from tutorial hell by building a real app!

A task manager or to-do app is one of the first I always make when learning a new language. I only spent a couple of weeks learning Go, (then moved on to C#), so there's a lot I don't know. I expect I'm doing some things wrong, but maybe it will help you if you are learning Go too.

You may find it useful to compare it to other versions I have done:
* [TaskTool](https://github.com/rwaddilove/tasktool-java) written in Java
* [TaskToolCmd](https://github.com/rwaddilove/TaskToolCmd) Alternative Java version
* [TaskTool](https://github.com/rwaddilove/TaskTool) Written in Python
* [TaskmanGo](https://github.com/rwaddilove/taskmango) Written in Go (Golang)
* [TaskmanCS](https://github.com/rwaddilove/taskmancs) Written in C#
